 + Describe:
    - Binary search algorith is used to efficently locate a target value within a sorted sequence of n elements.
    - When the sequence is unsorted, the stardard method is use a loop => sequential search algorithm (O(n))
    - When the sequence is sorted and indexable => should use binary search algorithm (O(log n)
 + Ideas:
    - The algorithm remains 2 parameters,'low' and 'high', such that all the candidate entries have index at least low
      and at most high. Initially, low = and high = n - 1
    - mid = (low + high)/2
